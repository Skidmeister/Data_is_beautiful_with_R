# Final assignment from the Data is Beautiful course with Prof. Michael Ingrisch

Prof. Ingrisch is leader of the group for Clinical Data Science at the Department of Radiology at LMU Clinic in Munich. In his elective course I was able to improve my skills in R and in Data Science.

Unfortunately Github cannot handle the .html file however `2022-01-13_Mikolaj_Cygan_Abschlussbericht.Rmd` file shows the final assignment that I had to do to complete the course. The `2022-01-13_Mikolaj_Cygan_Abschlussbericht_files/figure-html` folder contains the figures which I created when working on this assignment. 

During this course I have learned how to use R for Data Science, especially how to use the tidyverse library.
